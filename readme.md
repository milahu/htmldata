# htmldata

Manipulate HTML/XHTML/CSS documents.

## Features

- Compatible with Python 2.0 - 2.5.
- Extract and modify URLs in an HTML/XHTML/CSS document.
- Translate HTML/XHTML documents to and from list data structures.
- This allows you to read and write HTML documents programmably, with much flexibility.
- Use cases: robots, proxy CGI scripts, filtering of HTML and CSS, and flexible wget-like mirroring.
- Works in the "real world," unlike many Python HTML parsers.
- In other words, if a Web browser can parse it, then htmldata should parse it (that's the \*goal* at least...:-).
